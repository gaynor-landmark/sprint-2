Key Principles of User Centred Design

i. Most important principles
The first principle is the most important one to keep in mind - know your user!!!  If you can put yourself in the users position, understanding their world (work flow, terminology, what is import information, which are the most frequently performed tasks), you are more likely to design a self-explanatory flow, give good feedback to the user at the relevant times and reduce irrelevant info or steps.)
ii.  No - I think every one of those ten points is valid.
iii.  None surprised me.

ROI of UCD
i. I think what surprised me was the list of measurements that could so easily be used to work out how a change in software design has improved (or not) a site.  I guess the important thing to note here, is that you actually need to be measuring user interaction with your site to begin with.  With out measurements, you would probably not be aware that you had a problem.  It is so easy to rely on assumptions rather than un-shakeable facts.
ii.  No, I don't think it does.  Usability has always interested me - far more than complex sql!
