Pair Programming Notes

Reflection 1 - BEFORE
So having watched all the vidoes, I am anxious about how I will handle this.  There thoery looks good.  Communicate, communicate, communicate appears to be a key.  I can see why this could be a way of reducing mistakes, but I'm still sceptical about just how productive it will be.  Surely it can't be more productive that 2 people working separately.  I have had some experience with pair programming, but that was where I was trying to learn by watching.  It was definitely hard to keep up the concentration.  
Also, since I am not in Wellington, I am going to have to attempt this online, which will could make it even more difficult.  I am determined to be open to new ways of doing things, so will give it my best shot.  I'll be back to write some more after I have tried it.
