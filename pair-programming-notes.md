Pair Programming Notes

Reflection 1 - BEFORE
So having watched all the vidoes, I am anxious about how I will handle this.  There thoery looks good.  Communicate, communicate, communicate appears to be a key.  I can see why this could be a way of reducing mistakes, but I'm still sceptical about just how productive it will be.  Surely it can't be more productive that 2 people working separately.  I have had some experience with pair programming, but that was where I was trying to learn by watching.  It was definitely hard to keep up the concentration.  
Also, since I am not in Wellington, I am going to have to attempt this online, which will could make it even more difficult.  I am determined to be open to new ways of doing things, so will give it my best shot.  I'll be back to write some more after I have tried it.

Reflection 2 - AFTER
I paired with Andi B, who was very friendly and helpful.  She also has a good imagination and a sense of humour. We managed to build a basic HTML page using appear.in to communicate.  The first driver shared their screen and just typed straight into Notepad.  have way through, we swopped roles and transferred the text onto a new notepad file to continue. The navigator did the job of looking up things we were unsure about and there was lots of discussion along the way. This was a positive experience for me.  :-)
