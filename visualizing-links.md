Visualizing Links

i. NEVER underline text that is not a link.
ii. Unvisited links should be brighter, a more saturated version of the same hue, and more luminous for the colour-bling user.  Avoid red-green for the colour-blind.
iii.  "Perceived Affordance" is the quality of an object that suggest the way that it is used. eg.  The perceived affordance of a text link is that it is clickable if it is blue and underlined.
iv. Underlines can be safely eliminated only when the design indicates the function.  eg. a list down the left-hand side of a page will be assumed to be a list of nav links.
v. Blue should be reserved for links, as blue suggests strongly to a user that the text is a link.
vi. Non-underlined can have an underline or a link title added on hover.
vii. Link-titles pop up when users hover over a link and are used to give the user more information about where the link will take them before they click on it.
