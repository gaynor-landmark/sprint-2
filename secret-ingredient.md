Social Capital and Empathy

a) When building a team, Social Capital is the mortor that holds the bricks.  Social Capital is the connectedness that comes from getting to know and value the other members of your team.
b) I loved this article!  Having been part of both well-functioning and non-functioning teams, it is so clear why some worked and others didn't.  How important are trust and empathy to success?  Clearly FAR more important than I had realised.
