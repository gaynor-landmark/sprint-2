Empathy Experience

The department where I work at Massey University is in the process of being closed down.  Earlier in the year, half of my collegues went through the process of having their jobs disestablished, and having to go out and look for a new place of employment.  Looking back, I now see that I probably offered far more sympathy than empathy. Now it is time for the rest of us to go through the same process.  This time round, knowing how it feels, I have been able to offer empathy to my collegues rather than sympathy.  I have felt the frustration, anger and fear that they are feeling.  I have had the chance to apologise to some of those that I didn't support in the way I could have.  Even though I am going through the same process, I am trying to connect with and better support those that are left.  Hopefully it is helping.  I am glad I got a second chance. I feel it is a lesson that I won't easily forget.
