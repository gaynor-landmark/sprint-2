Color Contrast Checker

i. 1.21:1 Failed All
ii. 2.44:1 Failed All
iii. 3.57:1 Failed All
iv. 10.36:1 Passed All
V. 19.56:1 Passed All - disappointingly ugly, but I can see why black and yellow are used on number plates in some countries.
vi. 2.72:1 Failed All - most surprising to me.  Even lightening the mint green to white still didn't pass the contrast test.
vii. 3.26:1 Failed All
